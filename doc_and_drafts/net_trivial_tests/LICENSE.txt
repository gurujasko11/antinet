Information for some files (server.c server_udp.c client.c client_udp.c)

Code was found on Internet (and then modified by us), e.g.:
http://www.linuxhowtos.org/data/6/server.c
http://www.linuxhowtos.org/data/6/server_udp.c
http://www.linuxhowtos.org/data/6/client.c
http://www.linuxhowtos.org/data/6/client_udp.c
http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm

and according to http://www.linuxhowtos.org/category17/
it could be: "Copyright 2004-2013 Sascha Nitsch Unternehmensberatung UG(haftungsbeschr√§nkt)"
though no idea if this applies to the page including this example source code or not.
